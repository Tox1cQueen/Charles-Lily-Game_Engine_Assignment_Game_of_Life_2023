## Description of the project
You are a ranger that has travelled to a mysterious underground cave with these unique creatures, you are there  to observer how they interact with each other and how they interact with you. Each of the three AI have a way to wander around and some will run away from you if you get close while others will do the opposite and come towards you. And each ai does a unique interaction with either you or a different AI, so you must watch and find out what all they can do.

## Instructions for use
WASD for movement, holding SHIFT makes you sprint, spacebar to jump and you move the mouse to look around.

## How it works
Each of the AI is controlled by a state machine that swaps all the different behavers of the AI. They all have a wander, run and cry behaver with a unique one as well. The wander behaver is them going in random directions, the run behaver has them either move away or towards the player, and the cry behaver has them at random points play a sound effect that is tied to that AI. The drilbur AI also runs away from the player because it is scared of you but if u have food then it will come over to you and take it. Once you don't have food it will go back to being scared of you. The Zubat AI ignores the player as it has no eyes to see and can fly so it does not interact with the player or the other creatures. And the Goomy AI can follow the player or a drilbur AI if it get close.

## Description of the project
You are a ranger that has travelled to a mysterious underground cave with these unique creatures, you are there  to observer how they interact with each other and how they interact with you. Each of the three AI have a way to wander around and some will run away from you if you get close while others will do the opposite and come towards you. And each ai does a unique interaction with either you or a different AI, so you must watch and find out what all they can do.

## Instructions for use
WASD for movement, holding SHIFT makes you sprint, you the mouse to look around.
